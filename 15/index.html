      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:  
      <ol>
      Walla Walla, WA,Magic City, ID,Bountiful, UT,
      Last Chance, CO,Truth or Consequences and NM,Why, AZ.
      </ol>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May get you,<br>
      A glimpse,<br>
      Of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      <ul>
      <il>cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar.</il>
      </ul>
      Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
